# Intro to Javascript Assessments

Answer these questions, then follow the instructions to submit your first assessment!

#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?
A function is a reusable tool in programming you make that takes in inputs, performs a sequence of operations to it, and spits out a desired output.
#### 2. What is a method?
A method is a function inside a class that operates on a specific object. All methods are functions but not all functions are methods.
#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?
.charAt(), .toUpperCase(), .indexOf()
#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?
Mutators permanently change the array while Accessors only get information from the array so it doesn't change it. 
#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?
Console.log() prints something to the console while return does not. Console.log() also does not end the program or function while return will automatically end the function.
#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most? 
It's really helpful going through some examples in lecture.
